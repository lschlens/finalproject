        LeBron James, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball 
        players of all time, has left an indelible mark on the NBA and 
        sports in general. Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, he 
        displayed extraordinary athletic abilities at a young age. As a 
        high school phenom at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, his exploits 
        on the court attracted national attention, earning him the nickname 
        "The Chosen One." By the time he declared for the 2003 NBA Draft, 
        LeBron was already heralded as a future legend, and he was selected 
        first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
